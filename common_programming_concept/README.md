# Basic programming concept

This folder contains the code about basic programming concept. This README is used to hightlight some key concept.

## Variables

In Rust, variables are immutable by default. This means once a variable is bound to a value, you cannot change that value unless the variable is explicitly marked as mutable using the `mut` keyword.

## Data types

Rust has several built-in data types, including scalar types like integers, floats, booleans, and characters, as well as compound types like tuples and arrays. Understanding these types is crucial for effective programming in Rust.

## Functions

Functions in Rust are defined using the `fn` keyword. They can take parameters and return values. Rust enforces strict type checking, ensuring that the types of function parameters and return values are clearly defined.

## Comments

Comments in Rust are denoted by `//` for single-line comments and `/* ... */` for multi-line comments. Using comments effectively can help make your code more understandable and maintainable.

## Control flow

Control flow in Rust is managed through constructs like `if`, `else`, `loop`, `while`, and `for`. These allow you to execute different code paths based on conditions and iterate over collections.
