# Guessing Game - Rust

This is a simple guessing game implemented in Rust, following the tutorial from the [RustBook](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html). The game generates a random secret number, and the player has to guess the number. After each guess, the game will inform you whether your guess was too high, too low, or correct.
